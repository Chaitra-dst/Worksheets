11.List:
The simplest data structure in Python and is used to store a list of values. Lists are collections of items (strings, integers, or even other lists).
Each item in the list has an assigned index value.Lists are enclosed in [ ].
Each item in a list is separated by a comma. Unlike strings, lists are mutable, which means they can be changed.
Lists hold a sequence of values (just like strings can hold a sequence of characters).
Lists are very easy to create, these are some of the ways to make lists
Ex: list1 = ['2.3','three','1']

Tuple:
A tuple is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers.
The important difference is that tuples are immutable.
That we can’t change the elements of tuple once it is assigned whereas in the list, elements can be changed.

Set:
Sets are unordered.
Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed.
A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.
Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference etc.

Dictionary:
A dictionary maps a set of objects (keys) to another set of objects (values). A Python dictionary is a mapping of unique keys to values. 
Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed. The values that the keys point to can be any Python value.

12.no strings are not mutable.we can use replace function to replace "+" with space like 
a="I+Love+Python"
a.replace("+"," ")

13.The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. 
For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character 'B'.
To get the type of variable use type() ex: a="Hi" type(a) will give output as str(string).
