10.djusted R2 also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. If you add more and more useless variables
to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease. If you add more useful variables, adjusted r-squared will increase.
Adjusted R2 will always be less than or equal to R2.
R2 assumes that every single variable explains the variation in the dependent variable. The adjusted R2 tells you the percent age of variation 
explained by only the independent variables that actually affect the dependent variable.


11.A regression model that uses L1 regularization technique is called Lasso Regression and model which uses L2 is called Ridge Regression.
Ridge regression helps in bringing the difference between coefficients to minimum value whereas in case of Lasso regression helps in bringing some of the 
coefficient values to zero thus removing some of the features altogether.Lasso helps in case of dataset containing high number of features.

12.The variance inflation factor (VIF) quantifies the extent of correlation between one predictor and the other predictors in a model. 
It is used for diagnosing collinearity/multicollinearity. 
Higher values signify that it is difficult to impossible to assess accurately the contribution of predictors to a model.
The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of collinearity. 
A VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.

13.Real world dataset contains features that highly vary in magnitudes, units, and range.
Here feature scaling helps to weigh all the features equally.t is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or 
features of data.It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. 
Sometimes, it also helps in speeding up the calculations in an algorithm.


14.Mean absolute error, mean squared error and r2 score are different metrics used to evaluate the fit in linear regression.
R2 score is the proportion of variance in dependent variable that is predictable from independent variables i.e change in 
output when input is being changed.


15.From table
True positive(TP)= 1000
False negative(FN)=50
False positive(FP)=250
True negative(TN)=1200

Sensitivity Or Recall= TP/TP+FN = 1000/1000+50=0.95
Specificity= TN/TN+FP= 1200/1200+250= 0.82
Precision= TP/TP+FP= 1000/1000+250=0.8
Accuracy= TP+TN/TP+TN+FP+FN =1000+1200/1000+1200+250+50=0.88
